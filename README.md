# MVVM To-Do App in Flutter

## Overview
This app demonstrates the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern:
- Model: Represents data (Task).
- ViewModel: Business logic using `ChangeNotifier`.
- View: UI using Provider to react to state changes.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Launch with `flutter run`

## Reflection
This assignment helped me understand the MVVM pattern in a practical way. Separating the app into model, view, and viewmodel made the code easier to manage and test. I learned how to use `ChangeNotifier` and `Provider` for state management. The biggest challenge was understanding where logic should goâ€”learning to avoid putting business logic in the view was an important takeaway. Overall, this was a valuable exercise for building clean, maintainable apps.
